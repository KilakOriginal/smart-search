# Smart Search
## About
*Smart Search* is a simple search engine that supports both prefix and boolean text queries.

## Usage
1. Create a virtual environment (optional, but strongly recommended)
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python app.py`
4. Navigate to the server address in your webbrowser (`http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default)
5. Search our corpus of documents!

> [!WARNING]
> As of right now the search engine is **not functional**! The search itself is implemented, but the unpacking/rendering of the results is not yet implementet.

## Future Development
- [ ] Implement unpacking/rendering of search results
- [ ] Add document previews
- [ ] Add pagination to search results
- [ ] Render documents in a user-friendly way (clickable links, etc.)
- [ ] Improve core search algorithm (specifically ranking of results)
